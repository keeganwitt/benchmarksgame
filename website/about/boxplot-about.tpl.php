<p>The <b>direct comparison</b> between 2 programming language implementations will give you a better understanding of the differences in program performance than this summary page.</p>
<p>In some cases, a median score shown here is faster but the median time ratio shown in the direct comparison is slower. In those cases, the range of measurements for those 2 programming language implementations is really quite similar.</p>

<p>There are other ways to analyse and present this data: look for patterns in <a href="code-used-time-used-shapes.php">Code-used Time-used Shapes</a> or take the <a href="summarydata.php">Summary Data</a> and do your own analysis!</p>
