<p>My thanks to Jeremy Zerfas --

"Normally to do the n=16000 run it requires checking to see if a pixel "escaped" about 6 billion times. The programs which skip those checks can skip about 5 billion of those checks which can speed up the program considerably. For my program it improves performance by about 50%.

I took a look at the top 20 programs and the best program for each language and it looks like the affected programs which skip these checks include the program I just submitted and the Fortran #6, C++ #4, Haskell #3, and Perl #4 programs."</p>
