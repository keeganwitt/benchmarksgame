<p><b>ndiff -abserr 1.0e-8</b> program output N = 1000 with this <a href="iofile.php?test=<?=$SelectedTest;?>&amp;file=output">output file</a> to check your program is correct before contributing.
</p>

<p>We are trying to show the performance of various programming language implementations - so we ask that contributed programs not only give the correct result, but also <b>use the same algorithm</b> to calculate that result.</p>

<p>Each program should model the orbits of Jovian planets, using the same simple symplectic-integrator - see the <a href="benchmark.php?test=nbody&amp;lang=java">Java program</a>.</p>

<p>For background information see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem">N-body problem</a>. Useful symplectic integrators are freely available, for example the <a href="http://janus.astro.umd.edu/HNBody/">HNBody Symplectic Integration Package</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to Mark C. Lewis for this benchmark.</p>
